👁️‍🗨️ MUTUAL is a collective currently researching design culture inside the new, emerging internet.

Some ideas we're exploring :

- How to establish design standards for applications and experiences that utilize blockchain technology
- How to improve dialogue between protocol-level design and front-end design
- How to reduce assumptions about user experiences in the new internet

We're interested in exploring all possible routes that can lead to a more realized design culture on the decentralized web— one that embraces experimentation and innovation.
